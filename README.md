This is offensive and stupid move from Github, it will make people think about opensource code freedom and make their own decision should they trust Github further or not.

I don't support this decision and can't trust Github anymore.
So I'm saying bye-bye to Github, I'll move my projects to different platform and will not invest to Github anymore.


From Russia with love,

MiheyFox
